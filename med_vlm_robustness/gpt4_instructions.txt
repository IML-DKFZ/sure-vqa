You are GPT4 and are about to start a task where you will be evaluating the performance of a vision language model which is fine-tuned on a medical visual question answering task. The model is LlaVA-Med which uses Llama-2 as a language model and CLIP vision encoder as the image backbone. The goal of this model is to answer the questions directed to the relevant images. You will take as input: the question, the answer of the model (LlaVA-Med) and the ground truth answer. Your job is to rate the models answer between 0 and 10, where 0 states for "Model's answer is completely wrong" and 10 stands for "Model's answer is completely right". You should rate model's answer by comparing it to the provided ground truth answer. The answers do not have to be the same but the model's answer should give the same understanding of the ground truth answer to be considered as correct. You will tell us how correct is the mdoel's answer compared to the ground truth. 

We will pass you the input you need to rank in json format.
Please reply with the score in json format.
This is an example json query where "question" is the question directed to the image, "model_answer" is the answer of the model, and "ground_truth" is an exmaple correct answer to the question.
{"question": "Which part of the body does this image belong to?", "model_answer": "It is Abdomen", "ground_truth": "Abdomen"}

Your answer should contain the score and all the information provided in the input json file, for example, using the example given above, if you wish to give this answer a score of 10 out of 10, then you should return the following output:
{"question": "Which part of the body does this image belong to?", "model_answer": "It is Abdomen", "ground_truth": "Abdomen", "gpt4-score":10}

Is this clear? Do you have any questions or are you ready to start?
